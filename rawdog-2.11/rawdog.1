.TH RAWDOG 1
.SH NAME
rawdog \- an RSS Aggregator Without Delusions Of Grandeur
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rawdog
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page briefly documents the
.B rawdog
command.
.PP
\fBrawdog\fP is an RSS (and other) feed aggregator, based on Mark
Pilgrim's flexible feed parser. \fBrawdog\fP reads articles from a
number of feeds and writes out a single HTML file, based on a template
either provided by the user or generated by rawdog, containing the
latest articles it's seen.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`\-'). A summary of options is
included below. For a complete description, see the README file.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-update
Fetch data from the feeds and store it. This could take some time if
you've got lots of feeds.

.B \-w, \-\-write
Write out the HTML output file.
.TP
.BI \-f \ SOMEURL\fP, \ \-\-update\-feed \ SOMEURL

immediately, even if its period hasn't elapsed since it was last
updated.
.TP
.BI \-c \ FILE\fP, \ \-\-config \ FILE
Read
.I FILE
as an additional config file; any options provided in
.I FILE
will override those set in the main config file (with the exception of
"feed", which is cumulative).

may be an absolute path or a path relative to your .rawdog directory.
Note that $HOME/.rawdog/config will still be read first even if you
specify this option.

Print the template currently in use to stdout.
.TP
.BI \-a \ URL\fP, \ \-\-add \ URL
Add a new feed to the config file, using Mark Pilgrim's "feedfinder"
module to extract the location of the feed from
